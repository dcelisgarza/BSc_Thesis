# BSc. Thesis Public Release

This is the public release of my BSc. Thesis in Chemistry (yeah, I know). It unfortunately does not contain the main codes I wrote because updated and generalised versions of them may be used in future releases of the open-source computational and quantum chemistry package [CFOUR](http://www.cfour.de/).

Github's preview feature presents a bug which transposes part of the second appendix into the first. I can't fix that, but the .tex files compile the .pdf correctly.
